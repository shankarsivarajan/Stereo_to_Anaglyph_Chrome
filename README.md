 # Stereo to Anaglyph 

Convert side-by-side stereo images to red–cyan anaglyphs.

This extension is based on [Stereoscopic 3D Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stereoscopic-3d-viewer/gjihpcejlpnmjimgafnfmfkbglajmdlg). The "Dubois" method uses the method described [here](http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stphmkr/help/stereo_13.htm) and the "Half-Color Optimized" method uses the "Optimized Anaglyphs" described [here](https://3dtv.at/Knowhow/AnaglyphComparison_en.aspx).

- Open the stereo image in a new tab. This is to avoid the "canvas has been tainted by cross-origin data" error.

- In the context menu, select `Stereo to Anaglyph` > `Red–Cyan Dubois`. If the images are swapped, select `Cyan–Red Dubois` instead.

- To revert to the original image, select  `Stereo to Anaglyph` > `Original`.
